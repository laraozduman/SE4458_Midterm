    ### Welcome to Postman! This is your first collection.


    Collections are your starting point for building and testing APIs. You can
    use this one to:


    • Group related requests  

    • Test your API in real-world scenarios  

    • Document and share your requests


    Update the name and overview whenever you’re ready to make it yours.

        This is a GET request and it is used to "get" data from an endpoint.
        There is no request body for a GET request, but you can use query
        parameters to help specify the resource you want data on (e.g., in this
        request, we have `id=1`).


        A successful GET response will have a `200 OK` status, and should
        include some kind of response body - for example, HTML web content or
        JSON data.
